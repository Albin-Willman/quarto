# Quarto 

This is my quick take on the boardgame Quarto. The main purpose of this project is to learn more javascript in general and how meteor works in particular.


## Usage

run `meteor` from console and go to localhost:3000 and the game should be on.


### Dependencies

All installation instructions are for MacOs X.

#### meteor.js

```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

### Test framework

Added jasmine and velocity packages for tests


### TODO

- [ ] Create game object that keeps track of turns and also for game history.
- [ ] AI Api
- [ ] Player object could be human or AI
- [ ] Introduce Session to keep track of players
- [ ] Introduce turns
- [ ] Prompt player whos turn it is
- [ ] View old games
